List/Array:
In python, lists are arrays, which is a list of variables of multiple types. You references items in the array with an index.


Dictionary/Hash table:
Dictionaries are hash tables in python, which is a collection of keys and values. There is only one 'value' for any given key. Dictionaries are optimized for looking up values.

Tuples:
Tuples are sets. Values are distinct. Tuples are optimized to see if an item exists in the tuple.

Generator:
In Python, a generator is an object that can be looped over and can output values one at a time instead of delivering them all at once. This is preferred if you want to avoid greedy processes.
